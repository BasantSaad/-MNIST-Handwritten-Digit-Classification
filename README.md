# Handwritten Digits Detection ðŸ”¢

This project demonstrates handwritten digits recognition using a neural network. It utilizes the popular MNIST dataset to train and evaluate a model capable of identifying digits from 0 to 9.

## Features

- Jupyter Notebook implementation (`Handwrite digits detection.ipynb`)
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy metrics and prediction samples

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib pytorch
  ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BasantSaad/Neural-Network-algorithms.git
    cd Neural-Network-algorithms
    ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `Handwrite digits detection.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

## Dataset

This notebook uses the MNIST dataset, which is loaded directly using Pytorch.

## Project Structure

- `Handwrite digits detection.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and explanations
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Example Results

After training, the model should achieve high accuracy (~98%) on the test set. Sample predictions are visualized in the notebook.
